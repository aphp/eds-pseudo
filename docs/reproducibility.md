# Reproducibility

To guarantee the reproducibility of our models, we rely on virtual environments and VCS tools.

## Environments
We use [Poetry](https://github.com/poetry/poetry) to validate the constraints generated by the dependencies of our model, and lock the versions that were used to generate a model, in a `poetry.lock` file.

This file can be reused to reinstall a previous environment by running
```bash
poetry install --with docs
```

## Versioning

We use [DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) to version the experiences, models and datasets used.

To add and version a new dataset, run
```bash
dvc import-url url/or/path/to/your/dataset data/dataset
```

To (re-)train a model and package it, just run:
```bash
dvc repro
```

For more information about DVC, make sure to visit their [documentation](https://dvc.org).

## Article experiments

To reproduce the results of our article, run the `experiments.py` script to queue the experiments with DVC:

```bash
python experiments.py
```

Then, run the experiments:

```bash
dvc exp run --queue --run-all
```

??? tip "Tip for Slurm environments"

    If your computing resources are managed with Slurm, you can run `dvc exp queue-worker` from Slurm jobs instead of the last command to parallelize the experiments across multiple nodes.

    ```bash title="my_slurm_job.sh"
    # SBATCH ...

    dvc-worker-$SLURM_JOB_ID -v
    ```

    ```bash
    sbatch my_slurm_job.sh  # first job
    sbatch my_slurm_job.sh  # launch as many jobs at once as needed
    ```

To reproduce (some) of the figures of our article, run the `analysis.py` script to
generate the charts and tables in the `docs/assets/figures` folder.

```bash
python analysis.py
```

and visualize them by serving the documentation

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
