# Overview

EDS-Pseudo is a project aimed at detecting identifying entities in textual documents,
and was primarily tested on clinical reports at AP-HP's Clinical Data Warehouse (EDS).

The model is built on top of [edsnlp](https://github.com/aphp/edsnlp), and consists in a
hybrid model (rule-based + deep learning) for which we provide rules [`eds_pseudo/pipes`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/tree/main/eds-pseudo/pipes) and a training recipe [`scripts/train.py`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/blob/main/scripts/train.py).

We also provide a small set of fictive documents
[`data/gen_dataset/train.jsonl`](https://github.com/aphp/eds-pseudo/blob/main/data/gen_dataset/train.jsonl)
to test the method.

The entities that are detected are listed below.
